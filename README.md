# TwitchBot_full_rebuild
This is just a silly little twitch bot that I've been hacking together in order to teach myself how to write Python code.

Its ~~pretty~~ not so basic but I've learned quite a lot along the way.  I will refactor it into a new bot at some point in time ~~soon~~.

~~It's a mess of files and calls all over the place and it needs to be cleaned up, I just need to find the time to do that.~~

While its still a bit of a mess I've cleaned up the directory structure quite a bit.

If you're familiar with python and/or want to offer some suggestions I have a trello board setup for this bot at https://trello.com/b/CyeWbpNT/existing-rhylebot
