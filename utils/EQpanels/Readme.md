Current version: 1.0

Created: 2/6/2023

Usage:

- Extract all files preserving the directory structure
- In your streaming software of choise add a new Web Source
- Browse to the folder where you extracted the files
- Select character.html
- Viola!

To edit/update your character info:
- Open character.html in your preferred text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Atom(RIP))
- Edit the Name and level to represent the character you want
- Edit the server line as follows:
  - If you're playing on a P99 server and want the color'd name change the green in `<span class="green">` to the color you are playing on: red, green, or blue
  - If you are playing on LIVE remove the 'P99' and then you can change the 'green' in `<span class="green">` to 'live', then enter the server name you are playing on.

As you level up in EQ or switch characters you'll need to maually go in and update this file unless you have a bot that can do that for you... hint hint.
